# AEM 4501 – Spring 2025 

## Design Project – 2D Truss for Drone Ships 

### Team: Madhurima Das – Daniel Kurimay – Felicia Kedrowski 
 

## Executive Summary 

A 2D truss designed as a docking platform was created to hold four 2000 kg ships at the same time. During this project, it was determined whether the designed truss was capable of handling heavier masses without failure to optimize the drone mass/truss mass ratio and cost. The project requirement was to have a minimum of 8 meters of distance between the drones, a maximum deflection of 10 cm, and a factor of safety of 1.2 against all failure. The design of the truss is attached to points A and B as seen in Figure 1 below. The figure also describes the direction of the acceleration from the docked drone ships.
